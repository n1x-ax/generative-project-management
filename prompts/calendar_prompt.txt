Based on the comprehensive project information and detailed tasks provided, create a realistic calendar schedule for the project. The calendar should include start and end dates for each task, considering dependencies, estimated hours, and the nature of each task.

TODAY'S DATE: {current_date} (Use this as the project start date)

PROJECT CONTEXT:
Title: {project_title}
Description: {project_description}
Draft Plan: {draft_plan}

TASKS:

SCHEDULING GUIDELINES:
1. Create a realistic schedule that respects human capabilities and work-life balance
2. Different task types require different scheduling approaches:
   - Meeting tasks: Schedule for 1-2 hours within a single working day
   - Research tasks: Can span multiple days depending on complexity
   - Design tasks: Typically take 1-3 days depending on estimated hours
   - Development tasks: Schedule across multiple days based on estimated hours
   - Testing tasks: Allocate appropriate time based on complexity
   - Documentation tasks: Schedule based on estimated hours and complexity
   - Marketing tasks: Schedule appropriate duration based on deliverables
3. Each team member should not be overloaded with parallel tasks
4. Working hours are 8 hours per day, Monday through Friday only
5. Account for all task dependencies when scheduling
6. Each task's duration should respect its estimated hours, spreading hours across working days
7. The schedule should include all tasks from the provided task list, using the exact same task names and assignees

For each task in the schedule, please include:
1. Task ID: Use the exact task_id from the provided tasks
2. Task name: Use the exact task_name from the provided tasks
3. Assignee: Use the exact assignee from the provided tasks
4. Tag: Use the tag categorization from the provided tasks
5. Start date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
6. End date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
7. Start time (HH:MM format, for meeting-type tasks only)
8. End time (HH:MM format, for meeting-type tasks only)
9. Status: Use "Not Started" as default

For non-meeting tasks, leave start_time and end_time as null.
For meeting tasks, set both start_date and end_date to the same date, and include specific start_time and end_time.

The output should be in JSON format with the following structure:

[
  {
    "task_id": "string",
    "task_name": "string",
    "assignee": "string",
    "tag": "string",
    "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "end_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "start_time": "HH:MM or null",
    "end_time": "HH:MM or null",
    "status": "string"
  }
]
